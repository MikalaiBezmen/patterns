//An abstract factory has sets of methods to make families of various objects.

//In this example the AbstractSoupFactory defines the method names and return types to make various kinds of soup.

//The BostonConcreteSoupFactory and the HonoluluConcreteSoupFactory both extend the AbstractSoupFactory.

//An object can be defined as an AbstractSoupFactory, and instantiated as either a BostonConcreteSoupFactory (BCSF) or a HonoluluConcreteSoupFactory (HCSF). Both BCSF or HCSF have the makeFishChowder method, and both return a FishChowder type class. However, the BCSF returns a FishChowder subclass of BostonFishChowder, while the HCSF returns a FishChowder subclass of HonoluluFishChowder.
