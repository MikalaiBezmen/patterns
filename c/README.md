# Getting started

So far, have just a single pattern implemented, but here's what you need to get going.

I'm going to be using Autotools for the usual building and test steps:

	./configure
	make
	make check


Not an Autotools expert yet, but have done a 

	make dist

Which will a *c-patterns-1.0.tar.gz* file that I have been able to then:

	tar xzf c-patterns-1.0.tar.gz
	cd c-patterns-1.0
	./configure
	make
	make check

and get all to be built and test completely.  If you have issues along the way, ping me and I'll see if I can help.
