# JavaScript GoF patterns (compiled from coffeescript/)

# Running the tests

Install Node (get node.js and npm binaries)
Install git

    git clone git@github.com:markmontymark/patterns.git
    cd patterns/javascript
    npm install
    grunt 


After running 'grunt', you should see something like:

	Running "jasmine:src" (jasmine) task
	Testing jasmine specs via phantom
	.....
	56 specs in 0.005s.
	>> 0 failures

	Done, without errors.

If you don't, then I screwed up :)  Or maybe the `git clone` or `npm install` or `grunt` above failed?  Ping me if you need help.
